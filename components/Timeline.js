        Writing this the day after! I actually ran 7.7 miles and did my first
        day at HQ. Also ate an entire party-size bag of Doritos. Afterward, a
        group of us had taco dinner and stayed up until 1 AM playing Uno in
        Steve (apartment). We then decided to head over to HQ to sleep there for

        movie started, so I didn't watch it. The music is good to sleep too. The
        couch was so fucking tight that my back hurts so much, but it was also
        really cozy and I felt like I actually belonged. Like someone put their
        head on my shoulder, I kept kicking someone in the shins, and somebody
        was sleeptalking. You know, the awkward but sweet kind of close. There

          chess. We were originally going to go to a comedy special, but I don't
          regret anything. Actually, that reminds me of a quote I heard a while
          ago: when you're stuck between decisions that all have good outcomes,
          decide on the one that will make you regret the least. I need to write

          I felt like watching these fireworks with people that I had grown
          close and comfortable with and actually being able to mentally relax
          and let down my walls because my abusive mom wasn't there made me feel
          like I was at home for the first time in my life. This thought is

        <p>
          Last day of work in-person! Hackathon after work went super well. We
          had pizza, got hacking. Spent the entire night alternating between
          different playlists (okay, let's be honest, I played the most music)
          and working on different projects. Jammed away the entire night, had a
          chair fall down the stairs, played Among Us at 3AM. No expectations,
          no awards, and according to one person, one of the most fun hackathons
          they've been to. It was the right choice to do this! Originally wanted
          to walk on Church Street and go to sleep early but now I know this was
          the best decision I've ever made. Once again, I think the law of
          regret is in play again.

          Time to go home :( Reflecting back, this has been the most
          life-changing two weeks of my entire life, and I don't think a month
          in Boston is going to change that. That being said, this isn't a
          bye-bye, I'm seeing most of these people again in the future!
        </p>
        <p>
          I loved the big events, the after-work drives with music blasting in
          the car, having dinner parties nearly every night at different
          people's homes, making fun of people's fake IDs and drinking way too
          much White Claw, walks at night, but most importantly feeling at home
          for the first time in my life.

          I think I'm going to write a longer, more philosophical essay on my
          stay.

        <blockquote>
          <p>I just wanna, I just wanna know</p>
          <p>If you're gonna, if you're gonna stay</p>
          <p>I just wanna, I just wanna know</p>
          <p>I can't have it, I can't have it any other way</p>

          Bus ride to Boston. I can't believe I managed to package a month's
          worth of shit into one suitcase, and a broken one at that.

          Anyways, I'm writing this at 10 PM, trying to build the website for a
          hackathon I'm helping organize. (Yes I know, at this point I think
          it's an addiction.)

          I arrived in Boston around 1:00PM, got to my apartment and organized
          everything by ~2:00PM, and then met up with some other people to get
          ice cream at the{' '}

          (I really should have taken pictures) and then came home, then walked
          a mile to buy groceries from Target, then found out promptly that
          there was a Dollar Tree and Chinese supermarket closer to us while
          walking the mile back with a seven-pound grocery bag. Fun!

          Anyways, class starts tomorrow, so I really should go to sleep! 160mg
          of coffee is not doing anything for me.

          We got to try out the underwater robots in MIT's rec center!
          Specifically, the kiddie pool. We were all making jokes because it
          turns out some kid <del>pooped</del> defecated in the pool, and we had
          to reach our hands into the pool to pull the robots out. Anyways, the
          robots are so freakin' cool! I can't wait to actually get to program
          them. Oh, that reminds me, I need to borrow{' '}

          The college night fair thing was super boring, but the people I met
          totally made up for it. Left a couple of minutes after the booths
          opened, because they're just handing out pamphlets that I would have
          received in the mail anyways.

          Anyways, I need to catch up on math. I think everyone else I've met
          are definitely more math- and/or robotics- oriented, but I'm more
          programming oriented. I think I definitely recognized this when we
          were writing a simulation for calculating acceleration, velocity, and
          position of a still ROV today, and I was struggling with the math.
