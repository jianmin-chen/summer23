                    Eek, have a shit ton of stuff I'll be working on. Leaving
                    for Vermont tomorrow! I won't be able to stay at{" "}
                    <a href="">Hack Club HQ</a> the whole way through but I'm
                    still super excited to meet the awesome people I'll be
                    working with (specifically, <a href="">Jammers</a>!), and
                    maybe eat a bagel at Burlington Bagel Bakery again. We'll
                    see!
                </p>
                <p>
                    In preparation, I need to go pack my bag, which I still
                    haven't done.

                    Left at 8:50AM, got to Burlington at 5:40PM. Ate out at a
                    local diner - Al's French Fries! - and then met my new
                    roommates, who it turns out had invited a bunch of people
                    over! Seven people in total. We made burgers, curly fries,
                    and salad together, talked a bit, and watched{" "}
                    <a href="">Missing</a> together. Holy crap, I was either
                    laughing so hard or trying hard not to look at the screen.
                    I'm honestly nervous when it comes to new people, but it was
                    so much fun! Tomorrow we'll be going to a renaissance fair,
                    which I've never been to before. We'll see how it goes;
                    someone bought a $70 cowboy hat for the occasion! Anyways,
                    writing this and finishing up my BWSI courses right now.
                    It's close to 12AM!

                    Oh, I forgot to mention what I did on the bus. Well, first
                    of all, Albany's Union Station stinks. Would not recommend,
                    -infinity/10. I wanted to puke so bad, but it smelled like
                    weed outside and was humid, so I had no choice but to stay
                    inside. That being said, the WiFi also sucked, so I did a
                    lot of work on Marrow and also started reading{" "}
                    <a href="">Godel, Escher, Bach</a>.

                    Exhausting but fun day! Went to my first renaissance fair.
                    Lot of fun seeing the costumes, but it was so freakin' hot.
                    Afterwards, went to <a href="">Skinny Pancakes</a>, but I
                    didn't eat anything because right afterwards we headed over
                    to <a href="">Woody Keppel</a>'s house for a potluck dinner
                    and to watch a band, <a href="">Mal Maiz</a>, play music.
                    Literally so fun! The food people bought was so good, and
                    even though it started raining halfway, the show was still
                    super enjoyable (did I forget to mention that there was a
                    plate spinning introduction?) and we played some Man in the
                    Middle with a football while dancing to the music in the
                    rain, which was honestly so fun.

                    Coming home, some interesting music was played in the car,
                    so they're both going in my playlist:{" "}
                    <a href="">Runaway (U &amp; I)</a> and{" "}
                    <a href="">Live in the Moment</a>. The latter has these two
                    verses:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Let's live in the moment</p>
                    <p>Come back Sunday morning</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Um, it's a Sunday today! What a coincidence.</p>
                <p>
                    I decided on a whim to run to HC HQ tomorrow morning (7.7
                    miles, I just checked), with my roommate, which is exciting
                    because I get to see all the scenery as the sun rises (that
                    is if it isn't cloudy tomorrow), but also I'm sure pretty
                    traumatic because I think I've only ever run that far once.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyways, I need to sign off now. I smell like grass but I'm
                    going to shower tomorrow.

                Writing this the day after! I actually ran 7.7 miles and did my
                first day at HQ. Also ate an entire party-size bag of Doritos.
                Afterward, a group of us had taco dinner and stayed up until 1
                AM playing Uno in <a href="">Steve</a>. We then decided to head
                over to HQ to sleep there for the night, which meant curling up
                on the couch together and watching <a href="">Mamma Mia</a>. I
                actually promptly fell asleep a solid fifteen minutes after the
                movie started, so I didn't watch it. The music is good to sleep
                too. The couch was so fucking tight that my back hurts so much,
                but it was also really cozy and I felt like I actually belonged.
                Like someone put their head on my shoulder, I kept kicking
                someone in the shins, and somebody was sleeptalking. You know,
                the awkward but sweet kind of close. There was six of us on one
                couch! How the fuck is that possible!

                <p>Woke up at five today! Slept a solid four hours. Maybe.</p>
                <p>
                    Today was pretty solid! I spent most of the day programming.
                    For lunch, we invited <a href="">Jeffrey Hollender</a>, who
                    founded one of the first sustainable cleaning solution
                    companies, to come have a little picnic chat with us. His
                    son, who actually led Wikipedia's redesign project, also
                    came and talked about that a bit!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also had my first team sync today, followed by Ben &amp;
                    Jerry's ice cream right after. <a href="">Conrad Kramer</a>{" "}
                    is here! Honestly adults are so intimidating but I really
                    liked listening to his conversations with other people even
                    though I really don't know much about Rust, etc. I need to
                    add that to my summer bucket list.

                    Had another dinner party at someone else's apartment! This
                    one was more lowkey, I helped make some spicy vegan pasta
                    (courtesy of curry), and then we sat around with the vinyl
                    player on playing Hangman and chess. We were originally
                    going to go to a comedy special, but I don't regret
                    anything. Actually, that reminds me of a quote I heard a
                    while ago: when you're stuck between decisions that all have
                    good outcomes, decide on the one that will make you regret
                    the least. I need to write that down.

                <p>
                    Tomorrow I have to actually wake up early and get work done.

                    I remember my mom used to make me keep a diary, but there
                    was no point because my life was so boring I would write
                    about what I ate for breakfast everyday. Now I can't stop
                    writing because life is so fucking exciting. I feel so
                    fucking alive even though I have 3 mosquito bites, 2 back
                    pain hotspots, and 1 sleepy brain.

                Mostly another day of work! Afterwards we went to an Irish pub
                in the middle of Burlington. People may or may not have bought
                alcohol with a fake ID. Then we went to the Vermont Comedy Club
                for Wednesday Open Mic night. Some of the sets were hilarious,
                but by the end of the night, I had enough of penis jokes. Pretty
                fun though! I've been feeling like an adult, but I specifically
                felt like an adult tonight. I mean, I was in a pub! I mean, it's

                    Okay, I'm actually going to get shit done today. I came up
                    with a standup set! Maybe I'll perform locally in Boston
                    this summer ;) Adding that to my bucket list right now. It
                    goes like this, although more will be added to it:

                    I'm sitting at Tracy House right now and wrapping up a

                    little bit longer, but I have a very long TODO that I feel
                    like I need to check off to prove that I'm actually working
                    on shit and not just like, nothing? Then it feels like I'm

                played Frisbee and had a discussion on browser vulnerabilities.

                One of my roommates was in Canada so my other roommate and I
                went to the Y. I really should have eaten something, but it was
                okay. Afterwards I took a walk around the Church Street
                Marketplace. Highlights: used bookstore that{" "}
                <a href="">Belle</a> recommended (except I couldn't find any
                books that I could, you know, afford and that I also found
                interesting). Afterwards bought some canned pineapples and had a
                dinner with some people and watched the latest season of{" "}

                Stayed at home alone today. Did a bit of cleaning, wrote a lot
                of code. The weather outside was also pretty shitty so I did
                enjoy having a day alone to myself and playing music as loud as
                possible on the TV speakers. You know, it's pretty wack and

                    First up, today was a great day. I got actual work done, and
                    then we went to <a href="">Lake Champlain</a> to watch
                    Burlington's <a href="">annual fireworks show</a>. Even
                    though I have like fifteen billion mosquito bites, it was so
                    worth it because the food was good, the sunset was great,
                    the concert was great, and the drone show followed by
                    fireworks right after was fucking amazing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now onto thoughts. I was basically sitting there, watching
                    the fireworks, when I started thinking about the last few
                    days and realized: I'm in a new era of my life. I don't how
                    to explain it, but I felt like watching these fireworks with
                    people that I had grown close and comfortable with and
                    actually being able to mentally relax and let down my walls
                    because my abusive mom wasn't there made me feel like I was
                    at home for the first time in my life. Theis thought is
                    basically replicated in the song I recommended yesterday:

                Took a break for most the day! Ended up going to HQ for a while,

                having said hot pot, a few more people came. Watched Love

                    Tonight and tomorrow morning I have to do a lot of cleanup,

                    <li>Take one last shower here.</li>
                    <li>Finish slides for Sprig jam</li>
                    <li>
                        Finish some last things on my Markdown parser, which I'm
                        rewriting so I can use for writing my Pokedex jam.
                    </li>

                    Last day of work in-person! Hackathon after work went super
                    well. We had pizza, got hacking. Spent the entire night
                    alternating between different playlists (okay, let's be
                    honest, I played the most music) and working on different
                    projects. Jammed away the entire night, had a chair fall
                    down the stairs, played Among Us at 3AM. No expectations, no
                    awards, and according to one person, one of the most fun
                    hackathons they've been to. It was the right choice to do
                    this! Originally wanted to walk on Church Street and go to
                    sleep early but now I know this was the best decision I've
                    ever made. Once again, I think the law of regret is in play
                    again.

                    Time to go home :( Reflecting back, this has been the most
                    life-changing two weeks of my entire life, and I don't think
                    a month in Boston is going to change that. That being said,
                    this isn't a bye-bye, I'm seeing most of these people again
                    in the future!

                    I loved the big events, the after-work drives with music
                    blasting in the car, having dinner parties nearly every
                    night at different people's homes, making fun of people's
                    fake IDs and drinking way too much White Claw, walks at
                    night, but most importantly feeling at home for the first
                    time in my life.

                    I think I'm going to write a longer, more philosophical
                    essay on my stay.

                    Bus ride to Boston. I can't believe I managed to package a
                    month's worth of shit into one suitcase, and a broken one at
                    that.

                    Anyways, I'm writing this at 10 PM, trying to build the
                    website for a hackathon I'm helping organize. (Yes I know,
                    at this point I think it's an addiction.)

                    I arrived in Boston around 1:00PM, got to my apartment and
                    organized everything by ~2:00PM, and then met up with some
                    other people to get ice cream at the{" "}
                    <a href="">Microcreamery</a> (I really should have taken
                    pictures) and then came home, then walked a mile to buy
                    groceries from Target, then found out promptly that there
                    was a Dollar Tree and Chinese supermarket closer to us while
                    walking the mile back with a seven-pound grocery bag. Fun!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyways, class starts tomorrow, so I really should go to
                    sleep! 160mg of coffee is not doing anything for me.

                    First day of BWSI! Sat in the auditorium for way too much. I
                    fell asleep during Jane Abbott's lecture, but I got away.
                    Also got lost around MIT around 15 times, so doing super
                    great. Also lots of merch. That's it.
